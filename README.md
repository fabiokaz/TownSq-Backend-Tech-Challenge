# TownSq-Backend-Tech-Challenge: A Secure and Well-Crafted RESTful API

This project implements a robust and secure RESTful API built with Java and Spring Boot for managing purchase orders and payments. It prioritizes both security and code quality for a dependable backend solution.

## Key Features:

* **Purchase Order Management:** Efficiently create, retrieve, update, and delete purchase orders.
* **Payment Processing:** Securely handle payments associated with purchase orders. Only users with the `ACCOUNT_MANAGER` role can process payments, while all users can retrieve payment information.
* **User Management:** Create user accounts, retrieve your own user information, and update specific details like username and role.
* **Security:** Enforces robust security measures to protect sensitive data.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fabiokaz/TownSq-Backend-Tech-Challenge.git

2. **Modify users password**

   Access the `data.sql` file located in the `\TownSq-Backend-Tech-Challenge\src\main\resources\` folder and change the passwords for the `townsq_super` and `townsq_manager` users to a password of your choice, using BCrypt encoding.
   * **The reason these two users are created at system initialization is because the requirements specify that there must be a user named `townsq_super`, and other users should be created with the `DEFAULT` role.**
